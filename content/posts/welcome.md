Welcome to my clean, minimal blog built with Hugo and PaperMod, styled with Gruvbox colors.

## Features

- **Clean Design**: No clutter, just content
- **Gruvbox Theme**: Easy on the eyes with light/dark mode toggle
- **Monospace Font**: IBM Plex Mono throughout
- **Fast**: Static site generation with Hugo
- **Simple**: No unnecessary complexity

Click the theme toggle icon (☀️/🌙) in the header to switch between light and dark modes!

## Code Example

Here's some sample code:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

This blog is built to be simple and focused on writing.
